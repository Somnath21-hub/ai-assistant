 AI Voice Assistant is a beginner-friendly yet powerful voice-enabled Python program that simulates a personal digital assistant.This assistant is capable of listening to user commands through a microphone, converting those voice inputs into text using Google's Speech Recognition API, and performing smart actions in response. Whether you want to play your favorite songs on YouTube, fetch quick facts from Wikipedia, or simply hear a vocal response, this assistant brings it all together seamlessly. Using pyttsx3, it speaks back to you in a natural voice, making the interaction feel conversational and engaging. Built entirely in Python, this project serves as a practical demonstration of how speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and web automation can come together to create a real-time, responsive AI tool. Itâ€™s an excellent foundation for anyone interested in building smart assistants or exploring voice interaction systems, with clear potential for expansion into more advanced AI-driven applications.
